# A simple test which sets up a metadata-based subscription to automatically create a replication rule.
# This workflow consists of:
# - Upload of data into new dataset with metadata at RSE 1
# - Creation of metadata-based subscription to replicate to RSE 2
# Data should then be replicated at RSE 2 (to be manually verified).
